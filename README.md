- Accessibility is not optional
- Every pixel should earn its place

### 2. Business Philosophy (6 principles)
- Ship fast, iterate faster
- Open source beats closed gardens
- Developer experience is user experience
- Documentation is a feature, not an afterthought

### 3. MVP Philosophy (6 principles)
- Minimum Viable ≠ Minimum Valuable
- Focus on the 20% that delivers 80% of value
- Perfect is the enemy of shipped
- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Validate with real users, not assumptions
- Speed of learning > speed of building

### 4. Code Philosophy (5 principles)
- Code is read 10x more than it's written
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Optimize for deletion, not addition
- Make illegal states unrepresentable
- Duplication is better than wrong abstraction

### 5. Collaboration Philosophy (5 principles)
- Async by default, sync when needed

- Trust scales better than process
- Disagree and commit
- Feedback is a gift, not an attack

### 6. Product Philosophy (5 principles)
- Fall in love with problems, not solutions
- Build for power users, design for beginners
- Every feature has a cost
- User feedback is a compass, not a roadmap
- Distribution beats features

### 7. Performance Philosophy (5 principles)
- Fast is a feature
- Measure before optimizing
- Progressive enhancement beats graceful degradation

- **Spacing:** Adjust padding/margin (e.g., `p-8` → `p-12`)
- **Typography:** Modify text sizes (e.g., `text-4xl` → `text-5xl`)
- **Animations:** Customize Framer Motion variants
- **Dark Mode:** All components support dark mode via `dark:` prefix

### Adding New Components

1. Create component file in appropriate directory
2. Add showcase page in `/app/showcase/[category]/`
3. Update navigation in `/config/navigation.ts`
4. Follow existing patterns for consistency
